\section*{\LARGE Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Dr. Haojin Yang and Prof. Dr. Christoph Meinel. I want to thank them for giving me the opportunity to research this interesting topic, as well as for their guidance and advice. I especially want to thank Dr. Yang for his insights, support, and inspiration regarding the deep learning techniques used in my master's thesis.

I would also like to thank my colleagues Georg Wiese, Christian Bartz, Tom Bocklich, Norman Rzepka, Christoph Sterz, and Johannes Jasper for the many fruitful discussions about language identification and machine learning in general. I owe them a great deal of gratitude for supporting and encouraging me while working on this thesis. I am also very grateful for the stylistic critique, review, and language support by Christoph Sterz and Patrick L\"uhne.

Thank you.
