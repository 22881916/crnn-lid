    	\caption{Our proposed CRNN hybrid network architecture consists of two networks. A CNN transforms our input images into an intermediary representation of our audio frequencies. The 3D output of final convolutional layer of the CNN is sliced along the x-axis (time axis) into 2D time steps still containing all feature map information. The output of the final LSTM time step is fed into a fully connected layer for classification.}

    	\caption{An alternative approach for a hybrid CRNN network. Each single feature map of the final convolutional layer is fed to separate LSTM networks as a 2D input. Each LSTM interprets the vector entries along the x-axis as time steps and operates on thin slice of the data. The output of the final time step of each LSTM is concatenated into a single vector serving as the input to a fully connected classification layer.}
